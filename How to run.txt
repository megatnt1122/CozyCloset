TO RUN LOCALLY:
1st: 
         Navigate to django_project\django_project\settings.py, then edit the allowed hosts to be:
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1']

2nd: 
         open CMD and navigate to the folder that contains manage.py

3rd: Type:
         python manage.py runserver

IF YOU GET ANY ERRORS REGARDING LACKING MODULES -> search for that module on https://pypi.org/ and use pip install to install them... 
I will make a requirments txt in order to store all the module names for you to install. 


After step 3, copy url from
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
onto a web browser
